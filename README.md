Miss Pickle 1971

At Miss Pickle 1971, we are passionately Mediterranean in origins and flavours. We are also proudly Australian, sourcing only the best local and ethical produce whenever possible. Like the real Miss Pickle, who emigrated to Melbourne in 1971, nothing gives us more pleasure than sharing our real food. Just as she was, we are stubborn about how our food is made, choosing to prepare everything fresh and using the time honoured cooking traditions found across the Mediterranean. 
The colours, aromas and textures of every bite will transport you onto the streets and into the kitchens of Athens, Beirut, Tel Aviv & Cyprus.
